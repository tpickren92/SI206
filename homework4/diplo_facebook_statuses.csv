28071939336_10154762619799337,"My first bus tour was opening for Justice in 2009 it was sponsored by myspace! i thought at that moment. No way can electronic music get any bigger..!! this is it! we did it i was part of the biggest thing ! it was cool to be with Gaspard , Xavier , Pedro from Ed Banger Records. they were part of a french wave of music that influenced electronic music so massively in the USA.. it gave a face and a style and more importantly an attitude to the producers and DJ culture that was bubbling up everywhere.. they weren't Djs they were rock stars first .. after Justice the music got even harder and then went ever further pop .. but these guys stood up with the same mantra since those days and have been true to the music and kept making great stuff.. i don't think we could have had this scene without their pioneering style and vision. Ed Banger was a huge influence to what we could do with Mad Decent. #etjusticepourtous",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/diplo/photos/a.396614469336.167975.28071939336/10154762619799337/?type=3,2016-11-15 17:45:38,11891,117,156,10659,1124,92,14,1,1
